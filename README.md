# Sales-performance-and-Trend-Analysis
## 📌 Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard analyzes sales performance across payment modes, regions, and time periods using time intelligence functions. The interactive design enables users to explore trends, YOY growth, and monthly sales patterns, helping stakeholders make informed business decisions.

## 🎯 Objective
⦁	To visualize sales trends over time and compare year-over-year (YOY) performance.<br>
⦁	To analyze regional performance and payment mode preferences.<br>
⦁	To forecast sales patterns for better planning and decision-making.<br>

## 📂 About the Dataset
The dataset contains transactional sales data and includes:<br>
⦁	Sales amount, date, and payment mode details<br>
⦁	Regional sales distribution (North, South, East, West)<br>
⦁	Historical sales for multiple years for YOY comparison<br>

## 🔍 Recommended Analysis
⦁	How has total sales grown YOY?<br>
✅ Sales grew from ₹515.54M last year to ₹642.12M, showing a 0.25 growth rate.<br>
⦁	Which payment mode is most preferred?<br>
✅ Debit Card is the most used payment mode.<br>
⦁	How do regions contribute to total sales?<br>
✅ East (25.69%) and West (25.23%) regions lead, followed by South and North.<br>
⦁	What are the monthly sales patterns?<br>
✅ Strong peaks observed in Q2 and Q4 months, with consistent YOY improvement.<br>
⦁	How do weekdays affect sales?<br>
✅ Friday records the highest sales (~95M), followed by Wednesday and Thursday.<br>
⦁	What is the sales forecast for coming months?<br>
✅ Forecast shows a stable upward trend, with projected monthly sales around 58M.<br>
